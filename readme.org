#+DESCRIPTION: the OBJ protocol

+ status :: experimental

The purpose of this library is to provide PL-dependent /OOP
primitives/. This mostly means classes but includes the other
components such as generics,primitives,meta-objects,etc.

The two languages we care about are lisp and rust. In Lisp we have
CLOS and represent our custom classes with =defclass=. In Rust we use
the =trait= keyword to create new interfaces, =struct= for data, and
some proc-macros to fill in the gaps.

* Abstract
We describe OBJ as a collection of protocols. Protocols are sets of
functionality which are associated and specialized on object types.
